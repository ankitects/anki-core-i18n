## Most of these strings are used as column / row headings in a table.
## (Excluding -title and -subtitle)
## It is important to keep these translations short so that they do not make
## the table too large to display on a single stats card.

## N.B. Stats cards may be very small on mobile devices and when the Stats
##      window is certain sizes.
